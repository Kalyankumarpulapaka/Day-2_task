        Document vs Window Object In JavaScript</h1>
    <p>The document and window objects are two of the most important objects in JavaScript. They represent the HTML
        document and the browser window, respectively. While they are often used together, there are some important
        differences between them.</p>
    <h2>Document Object</h2>
    <p>The document object represents the HTML document that is loaded in the browser window. It has properties and
        methods that can be used to access and manipulate the document's content, structure, and style. </p>
    <p><strong>For example :</strong> you can use the document.getElementById() method to get a reference to an HTML
        element by its ID. You can then use the element's properties and methods to change its content, style, or
        behavior.</p>
    <h2>Window Object</h2>
    <p>The window object represents the browser window in which the HTML document is loaded. It has properties and
        methods that can be used to control the window's size, position, and behavior. For example, you can use the
        window.resizeTo() method to resize the window to a specific width and height. You can also use the window.open()
        method to open a new window.</p>
    <h2>Differences Between Document and Window Object</h2>
    <p>The following table summarizes the key differences between the document and window objects:<br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Document Object</th>
            <th>Window Object</th>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: left;">
            <ol>
                <td>Description</td>
                <td>Represents the HTML document</td>
                <td>Represents the browser window</td>
            </ol>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: left">
            <td>Properties</td>
            <td>Properties related to the document's content, structure, and style</td>
            <td>Properties related to the window's size, position, and behavior</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: left">
            <td>Methods</td>
            <td>Methods for accessing and manipulating the document's<br> content, structure, and style</td>
            <td>Methods for controlling the window's size, position, and behavior</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
